## PRODUCT HEALTH AT FREEZE

**BROKEN.** Baseline integrity is PASS, while independent product findings remain open.

- Findings: 44; active P0: 0; active HIGH: 3; potential HIGH: 1; open HIGH: 4; resolved: 6.
- Broken flows: 0; partial flows: 9.
- Default suite: 207/214, with the same seven preexisting failures; focused branding validation: 114/116 with two unrelated preexisting failures; typecheck PASS; lint PASS with 23 warnings; build PASS with its existing warning; new regressions: 0.
- Infrastructure health: **DEGRADED** because independent findings remain open. Git auto-deploy is DISABLED.

## HIGH #1 FINAL STATE

- `risk.gate-credential-revocation-does-not-revoke-session`: **RESOLVED / HIGH / P1**.
- EXPAND and CONTRACT: `APPLIED_AND_VALIDATED`; CONTRACT applied at `2026-09-13T18:11:18.773635Z` with SHA-256 `bb90b8da28217c1cdfa86bc68780aac05fbb8c16cb8058d2ba55f9d48e16a525`.
- Gates A-I: **PASS**. Canonical semantics: F=`STRICT_TICKET_VALIDATION`, G=`STRICT_COMBO_VALIDATION`, H=`TEMPORARY_CREDENTIAL_REVOCATION`, I=`FIXED_CREDENTIAL_REVOCATION`. Dual-mode: **ENDED**. Ticket/combo authorization: **STRICT_ONLY**. Source attribution: **NOT_NULL / IMMUTABLE**.
- Historical source-null rows: 1 before CONTRACT, 0 after; the preserved row is classified `legacy_unattributed`.
- OLD_APP + FINAL_DB: `INCOMPATIBLE_BY_DESIGN`; OLD_APP rollback is unsafe.
- Production is `dpl_H3kDzmLYYfQn8hmcynMhPWYjm5Qo`, READY, serving exact source commit `d2b2857c2ccf4023bfd4dc926b7b46b8acf836b8`; scoped active-brand runtime checks passed and relevant log errors are 0. Git auto-deploy remains DISABLED.

## BASELINE 2.1.0 SCOPED ACTIVE-BRAND RESOLUTION

- SemVer reason: **MINOR_COMPATIBLE_FUNCTIONAL_CHANGE**.
- `legacy.active-brand-contamination`: **RESOLVED / HIGH / P1** for `DOCUMENTED_AND_REAUDITED_ACTIVE_SURFACES`.
- All active surfaces documented and revalidated for the finding were corrected and passed Preview `dpl_4MAmzsQ6NVM36W1uie5VoVJas9zW` and Production `dpl_H3kDzmLYYfQn8hmcynMhPWYjm5Qo` on source `d2b2857c2ccf4023bfd4dc926b7b46b8acf836b8`.
- Checkout pending/success, five public-help topics, scoped router prompts, CSS assets and static CORS contain zero scoped legacy-brand references; `rota5.webp` and `rota5_mb.webp` return HTTP 200; relevant Production log errors are 0.
- This resolution is scoped to the active surfaces documented and revalidated for this finding. It is not a repository-wide assertion that historical brand strings do not exist elsewhere.
- Supabase and Ticketeira were unchanged. Product health remains **BROKEN** and infrastructure health remains **DEGRADED**.

## BASELINE 2.0.1 SEMANTIC CORRECTION

This PATCH changes only the F-I labels. Runtime evidence, PASS results, finding lifecycles, source identity and remote state are unchanged from 2.0.0.
